This is a client-side only React application for AI photo demo, created with [app.build](https://app.build), an open-source platform for AI app development.

Core stack:
- React 19 with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for the frontend;
- TypeScript for type safety;
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for UI components;
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling;
- [Zod](https://zod.dev) for schema validation.

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Docker

#### Build and run with Docker (simple approach):
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Build Docker image
docker build -t aie-demo .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:80 aie-demo
```

#### Full Docker build from source:
```bash
# Build with full Dockerfile (includes npm install in container)
docker build -f Dockerfile.build -t aie-demo .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:80 aie-demo
```

## Project Structure

- `client/` - React frontend application with camera capture and photo submission functionality
- `tests/` - Playwright tests for end-to-end testing
- `dist/` - Built application output (generated by `npm run build`)

## Key Features

The application allows users to capture photos using their device camera and submit them along with an email address. All processing is done client-side with no backend required.

## Development Notes

- Uses React 19 (may require `--legacy-peer-deps` for some packages)
- Vite handles TypeScript compilation automatically
- All dependencies consolidated into a single `package.json`
- Docker build uses nginx to serve static files with SPA routing support
